## üìù Notes for Next CTO

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE SESSION PRIORITIES**

**CEO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND AND OPTIMIZE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM WE JUST BUILT**

### **What Was Built (Aug 17, 2025)**
1. **Complete UAT Support System** now live at https://connie.plus
   - Fixed blue "Get Support" and red "Report a Bug" buttons on every page
   - Bug reporting form with severity/category classification
   - Smart help routing (chat when available, email when offline)
   - All built with Twilio Paste design system
   - Fully deployed and accessible in NSS CRM container

### **Current State (What Works Now)**
- ‚úÖ Forms collect data and log to console
- ‚úÖ Business hours detection (9-5 PST for chat availability)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive form validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Responsive design works in iframe CRM containers
- ‚úÖ Zero CORS issues (server-side API routes)

### **What Needs Implementation (Your Tasks)**

#### **1. Email Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **File**: `pages/api/support/submit-bug.ts` and `pages/api/support/submit-ticket.ts`
- **Status**: Comments show exactly where Mailgun integration goes
- **TODO**: Uncomment Mailgun code, add API keys
- **Question**: CEO wants to know WHERE tickets will go and HOW they're retrieved

#### **2. Live Chat Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)**  
- **File**: `pages/support/get-help.tsx` (line 88: handleStartChat function)
- **Status**: Placeholder alert, needs Twilio WebChat widget
- **TODO**: Integrate Twilio Conversations API for real-time support
- **Current**: Shows "Chat integration coming soon" message

#### **3. Middleware Updates (CRITICAL for HHOVV)**
- **File**: `middleware.ts` (line 15-17)
- **Status**: Hardcoded to NSS domain only
- **TODO**: Add HHOVV domain for Sept 1st launch
- **Current**: `frame-ancestors` only allows NSS

#### **4. Testing & Optimization**
- **TODO**: End-to-end testing with CEO
- **Focus**: Email delivery, chat functionality, multi-tenant support
- **Goal**: Production-ready for NSS immediate use, HHOVV Sept 1st

### **Key Files to Understand**
```
connie.plus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/GlobalNavigation.tsx     # Support buttons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/support/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report-bug.tsx                  # Bug report form  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ get-help.tsx                    # Help routing logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/api/support/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ submit-bug.ts                   # Bug submission API
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ submit-ticket.ts                # General support API
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ check-availability.ts           # Business hours logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts                       # CORS/iframe config
```

### **How We Built It (In Case You Need to Modify)**
1. **GlobalNavigation**: Fixed position buttons (top-right)
2. **Forms**: Full Twilio Paste components with validation
3. **API Routes**: Server-side to avoid CORS (no browser external calls)
4. **Smart Routing**: Business hours logic determines chat vs email
5. **Deployment**: NEW git workflow (no more rsync - see CLAUDE.md)

### **CEO Expects You To Know**
- Exactly how the support system works
- Where emails will be sent and how to retrieve them
- How to set up live chat integration
- How to test and optimize the entire flow
- How to handle multi-tenant support (NSS + HHOVV)

### **üéØ UAT STRATEGY FRAMEWORK TO IMPLEMENT**
**CEO PROVIDED THIS OUTLINE - NEEDS TO BECOME CONNIE.ONE PAGE:**

**User Acceptance Testing**
Objective: Capture deficits, opportunities, ideas, requests in Connie 2.0 prototype

**Front End:**
- Beta Tester Selection (geotargeting, channel availability, volume, service verticals)
- Beta Tester Onboarding (application form ‚Üí review ‚Üí accept ‚Üí onboard)
- Beta Test Tools (how testers submit bugs, find tools, use them)  
- Beta Tester Support (who's responsible, response times, coverage hours)

**Back End / Technical Infrastructure:**
- Tenant Provisioning (how testers get Connie account access)
- Feedback Loop Systems (onboarding, communications, weekly calls)
- Tracking & Reporting (deficit reporting, priority classification, feature pipeline)

**CRITICAL**: This framework connects to the support system we just built!

### **Previous System State**
- All production systems stable
- NSS email system restored but requires monitoring
- Support system now ready for immediate NSS use
- HHOVV needs middleware update for Sept 1st launch
