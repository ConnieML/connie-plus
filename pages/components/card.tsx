      Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the
      coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be led by a thief is
      to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be lied to. To be led by
      a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.
