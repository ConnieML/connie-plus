# Connie Active Work Tracker

*Last Updated: 2025-08-26 8:30 AM PST*

## üöß Currently In Progress

**Phase 2: Live Chat Integration** - Ready to begin after successful Phase 1 completion

## üìã IMMEDIATE SITUATION REQUIRING DECISION

### **CONTEXT: Live Chat Implementation Status**
We have **successfully deployed** a comprehensive support system to production with one remaining component: **live chat functionality**. All other systems are working perfectly.

### **CURRENT PRODUCTION STATE**
‚úÖ **Working Components (Deployed & Live):**
- Support ticket creation with proper TaskRouter integration 
- Ticket details display with customer attributes (name, email, phone)
- WebChat launcher properly positioned and functioning
- PostMessage system correctly sending customer data to parent window
- Cross-origin iframe communication established
- Production deployment pipeline verified and working

‚úÖ **Integration Success:**
- trouble-ticket-app.vercel.app ‚Üí TaskRouter ‚Üí ConnieCare Team queue
- Customer attributes flowing correctly: `customerName`, `customerPhone`, `createdAt`
- CORS configuration working between connie.plus and trouble-ticket-app
- All builds clean, no TypeScript errors, production stable

### **THE ONE REMAINING ISSUE: WebChat Cross-Origin Complexity**

**Problem:** Twilio WebChat 3.0 fails when initialized inside Enhanced CRM Container iframe due to browser security restrictions (different domains: connie.plus iframe within nss.connie.team parent).

**Current Solution Attempted:** PostMessage architecture where:
1. Customer fills form in connie.plus iframe ‚Üí 
2. PostMessage sends data to parent Flex window ‚Üí
3. Parent loads/initializes WebChat with customer data ‚Üí
4. WebChat routes to ConnieCare Team queue

**Status:** Technical implementation complete, but requires loading handler script in parent Flex window.

### **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION POINT**

**CEO Question:** "Should we continue with complex Twilio WebChat integration OR pivot to self-hosted chat solution?"

#### **Option A: Complete Current Twilio WebChat PostMessage Integration**
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Technical foundation already built and deployed
- ‚úÖ Integrates with existing TaskRouter workflow  
- ‚úÖ Uses existing RTC+Flex infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Could be completed today with parent script deployment

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Complex cross-origin postMessage architecture
- ‚ùå Requires ongoing maintenance of custom handler scripts
- ‚ùå Dependent on Twilio WebChat API changes
- ‚ùå All eggs in Twilio basket (as CEO noted)

**Remaining Work:** Load `https://connie.plus/flex-webchat-handler.js` in NSS Flex environment

#### **Option B: Pivot to Self-Hosted Chat (Rocket.Chat on connie.technology)**
**Strategic Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Independence** - Not locked into Twilio ecosystem
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture** - chat.connie.technology ‚Üí webhook ‚Üí TaskRouter
- ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant Ready** - Can serve NSS, HHOVV, future clients
- ‚úÖ **No Cross-Origin Issues** - Standard widget embed
- ‚úÖ **Cost Control** - Open source, self-hosted
- ‚úÖ **Customization** - Full control over chat experience

**Integration Pattern:**
```
connie.plus Enhanced CRM Container ‚Üí 
chat.connie.technology Rocket.Chat widget ‚Üí 
webhook ‚Üí existing TaskRouter integration
```

**Implementation Scope:** 2-3 hours estimated (vs potentially weeks debugging WebChat edge cases)

### **CURRENT FILE STATES FOR NEW CTO**

#### **Key Deployed Files (Production Ready):**
```
connie.plus/pages/support/get-help.tsx - PostMessage WebChat implementation
connie.plus/pages/support/create-ticket.tsx - Working ticket creation 
connie.plus/public/flex-webchat-handler.js - Parent window handler script
trouble-ticket-app/app/api/webhook/taskrouter/route.ts - TaskRouter integration
```

#### **What Works Right Now:**
1. **Support Tickets**: Full end-to-end flow working perfectly
   - Form submission ‚Üí trouble-ticket-app ‚Üí TaskRouter ‚Üí ConnieCare Team queue
   - Customer attributes properly displayed in Flex tasks
   - Ticket details card shows correct property names

2. **WebChat Infrastructure**: PostMessage system deployed
   - Customer form in Live Chat card (name + email fields)
   - PostMessage successfully sends data from iframe to parent
   - Handler script ready to receive and process messages
   - Alert confirms message transmission

#### **Current Technical Debt:**
- Complex postMessage architecture that requires parent window script management
- Cross-origin iframe restrictions that may create ongoing edge cases
- Dependency on Twilio WebChat API evolution

### **WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT (CEO DECISION REQUIRED):**

#### **If Proceeding with Twilio WebChat (Option A):**
1. **Immediate Task**: Load parent handler script in NSS Flex environment
2. **Test**: Full customer journey from form to ConnieCare Team queue
3. **Deploy**: Replicate configuration for HHOVV (Sept 1st)
4. **Risk**: Ongoing maintenance of complex cross-origin architecture

#### **If Pivoting to Rocket.Chat (Option B):**
1. **Infrastructure**: Setup Rocket.Chat on connie.technology server
2. **Integration**: Build webhook handler (similar to existing trouble-ticket-app pattern)  
3. **Deploy**: Replace WebChat widget embed with Rocket.Chat widget
4. **Advantage**: Clean, maintainable, independent architecture

### **RECOMMENDATION:**
Given CEO's strategic concern about "all eggs in Twilio basket" and the complexity we've encountered, **Option B (Rocket.Chat)** offers:
- **Faster time to market** - Less debugging, cleaner implementation
- **Strategic independence** - Reduces Twilio vendor lock-in
- **Better scalability** - Self-hosted solution under full control
- **Cleaner architecture** - Standard webhook pattern (like current ticket system)

### **NEXT CTO INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Review this decision** with CEO - Option A vs Option B
2. **If Option A**: Load `flex-webchat-handler.js` in NSS Flex, test end-to-end
3. **If Option B**: Setup Rocket.Chat on connie.technology, build webhook integration
4. **Critical**: Update HHOVV middleware for Sept 1st launch (both options need this)

5. **TypeScript + Twilio Paste** - Clean builds, accessible UI components, professional appearance

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Details for Phase 2:**
1. **TaskRouter Attribute Structure** - Must maintain exact same pattern for chat integration:
   ```javascript
   {
     name: "Display name for agent",
     type: "support_ticket" | "chat_conversation", 
     skill: "Support",  // Critical for routing
     customers: { name, phone, organization },
     origin: "NSS" | "HHOVV" | "DevSandBox",
     channel: "support-ticket" | "chat",
     channelType: "support"
   }
   ```

2. **CORS Configuration Pattern** - Same allowedOrigins approach needed for chat widget
