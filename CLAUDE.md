## âœ… CURRENT STATUS - Authentication SUCCESS!

### ðŸŽ‰ **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED:**
- **Date:** July 14, 2025
- **Status:** Standalone Okta authentication WORKING
- **User can login and access authenticated app**

### ðŸ”‘ **Key Fix Applied:**
- **Problem:** Wrong issuer URL in environment config
- **Solution:** Changed from `https://trial-2094636.okta.com/oauth2/default` â†’ `https://trial-2094636.okta.com`
- **Root Cause:** Okta instance uses root domain, not `/oauth2/default` authorization server

### ðŸ“‹ **Current Working Configuration:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_ISSUER=https://trial-2094636.okta.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=0oat7hjmxbdY525p9697
NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

### âœ… **Completed Items:**
- [x] Okta app created and configured
- [x] Environment variables set correctly
- [x] iframe embed and CORS permissions set
- [x] User assignments configured
- [x] Standalone authentication flow working
- [x] User can login and see authenticated content

### ðŸš€ **Next Steps (After Break):**
- [ ] Test `/debug` page to verify user info
- [ ] Test iframe authentication with `test-iframe.html`
- [ ] Test postMessage communication
- [ ] Deploy to production (`https://v1.connie.plus`)
- [ ] Test full Flex CRMcontainer integration

### ðŸ›  **Test Files Created:**
- `test-iframe.html` - Parent window simulation
- `/simple-test` - Okta endpoint testing
- `/debug` - Authentication state inspection
